<center><p>"Customer service is the provision of service to customers before, during, and after a purchase. The perception of success of such interactions is dependent on employees "who can adjust themselves to the personality of the guest".[1] Customer service concerns the priority an organization assigns to customer service relative to components such as product innovation and pricing. In this sense, an organization that values good customer service may spend more money in training employees than the average organization or may proactively interview customers for feedback."</p><br><br><br><hr></center>

        <li> If you don’t service your car, you might run into problems that could have been prevented. But there is more to the story. So, what else happens if you don’t service your car?

One of the examples relates to your engine oil. If the oil is not replaced, dirt and debris might build up in your engine and cause a sludge. As much as we’d like to say you could do it yourself, it’s better to get someone who really knows what they’re doing.
